            <p> Hello! </p>
            <p>
                My name is Dillon Hall and I am a graphic designer and illustrator from Las Vegas.
                I'd like to share a bit of who I am and what I’m about with you.
            </p>
                My biggest inspiration is Galileo and the years he spent making telescopes and drawing what he saw when he looked through.
                He constantly worked to make better telescopes and revise his earlier notes. He was not afraid to make goofy rough drafts
                (like thinking Saturn’s beautiful rings were ears) because he knew his hard work would result in a better understanding
                of the universe and his place in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graphic design and illustration are my telescopes.
                Using these tools try to look at and better understand the world and how we interact and live with one another.
                I strive to use these tools to reach out and share what I’ve discovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions or if you have a cool project you’d like to share with me, my contact info is below.
                I'd love to hear from you!
            </p>
            <p> Thank you! </p>
